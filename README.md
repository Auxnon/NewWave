# NewWave
Project name for the current home page of https://Makeavoy.com

- App-like interface works seemlessly on desktop or mobile
- drag and rearrage app bar, place on home screen, properly updates z-index depending
- App sorting (WIP)
- Lazy loaded content allowing for fast Time to Interaction and near perfect lighthouse score
- Three.js enabled apps including
    - Floating island
    - Vaporwave skull
    - 3d bar graph system (very WIP)
    - Portfolio site with overly-complex rearranging tiles
    - Chat system that plugs into Socket.IO, Passport.js, Sequelize single user (me) auth with multi guest accounts, allowing anyone to message me
    - And more coming soon!
