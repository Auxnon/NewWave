                    <h2>ConnectReport</h2>
                    <p>ConnectReport was the first major project I worked on. This small company brought me on as technical support. However due to the small team, I was quickly upgraded to a quality assurance technician with some minor coding roles. I converted the griding system to SVG which accommodated for the abstract cell sizing, as well as optimizing some neighboring cell collision detection. Allowing for Internet Explorer compatibility meant predating ECMA6 so Babel was a necessity. Also required working with various APIs in order to generate compatible files and allowing for import/export. Worked with Node.js, AngularJS and a team oriented git environment. </p>

                    <h2>Makeavoy</h2>
                    <p>This site, Makeavoy.com, utilizes all of my favorite techniques I've picked up over the years. It's a little experimental as it's exploring what's possible for a single page application, so don't be surprised if the source is a little bit sloppy! There's a lot going on under the hood so I'm going to break it down here...</p>
                    <h2>Backend</h2>
                    <p>I primarily use node.js for it's approachable nature coming from a front-end background.
                        Vhost and express.js take care of the subdomain routing so I can easily incorporate multiple projects and easily separate <abbr title="Progressive Web App">PWA</abbr> manifests. Socket.io trivializes the WebSocket for chat communications and rapid status updates. Although I also utilize a physics server for another experimental project i just call <a href="https://dev.makeavoy.com">Social Game</a>. There's also MariaDB and SQLite3 databases for testing user authentication. After that, the various projects are separated by folders and sub modules to keep things organized. It's all rolled out on my locally hosted Ubuntu server. It was Arch Linux but I opted for something a little more mainstream for maintenance reasons :)
                    </p>
                    <h2>FrontEnd</h2>
                    <p>
                        The main site utilizes a lot of 3D via Three.js. Due to the above average script sizes, everything is lazy loaded on demand in order to reduce the Time to Interaction. The Rendering system is triggered to load at runtime, while each additional "app" is loaded upon clicking so as to only load the necessary content, at the cost of some load time. The initial payload hosts the basics such as the 3D CSS loading animation, and the app navigation system. The site loads in a self made SVG title that 'draws' into place by a stroke-dashoffset. It also includes dynamic app button movement and placement ala an iPad, and a snazzy vector based drawing system to animate the navigation bar using perpendicular velocity offsets. The title accommodates for the bar as well. Finally, each app when loaded in applies to Canvas3D the scene contents and animation cycles. Upon swapping apps, the buffer is dumped to an image raster and stealthily swapped in for a clean load out. This is because there can only be one Canvas3D at any given time, so this was a nice hack. Finally hit the top right icon to toggle night mode! All 3D and SVG assets are my own.

                         Currently the main page hosts 5 apps. First two being mostly artistic intent: a floating island landscape, and vapor wave style skull. After that you can try the bar graph generator, try any data range, only real number arrays please! Currently you're in my portfolio app, which is over the top with its adjusting panels, but it does support left, right, spacebar, and escape for some accessibility options. Finally the chat app is a fully functional messaging system that only I can read. It supports infinite rooms for as many guest users want to send me a message, and is capable of saving to logs so I should be able to read them after the fact. I have a lot of one off ideas I want to host on the main page, since it only loads what it needs. Stay Tuned!

                <h2>Social Game - experimental online board game</h2>
                <p>
                    This was an extremely ambitious project. As mentioned before, the server hosts an instance of Cannon.js that keeps synced up with local user instances of Cannon.js in order to replicate a multiplayer physics sandbox experience on a hexagonal grid game platform. The current results are less then ideal as the updates are not constant in order to not strain the server. But aside the occasional physics artifacts it has the ability to 'store' 3D items into the DOM, send messages including 16x16 images, modify the terrain on the fly, and user authentication and administration. There was also a D&D character sheet implemented that saves into a sqlite3 database. Everything is very WIP. An "infinite" terrain system is in the works, as well as height maps, inverse kinematics animation systems, better environmental GLSL effects, and waypointing. Like i said, extremely ambitious. But I'm super happy with it so far!

                    You can try one of the test users, their names all start with "B", login is just 1234. Don't crash it ðŸ˜‰

                    <h2>Desk.js - User Interface</h2>
                    <p>This experimental interface is intended for touchscreen. Created as means to test the possibility of managing multiple window or objects with separate hands and fingers, It registers all of 10 fingers separately. You can drag an item with one finger while moving another item with a separate finger, or resize one item with one hand while moving or expanding another interdependently. When items overlap, they can be moved together just like you could with a stack of papers (toggleable logic). You can also drag an image file to it from the desktop to paste in images, or double tap a square to paste text. Context menu (long press or right click) the desktop brings up a radial menu. The entire project is a bit rough and really needs an update to iron out the bugs, including some lag only on iOS. </p>

                    <h2>Fruit App</h2>
                    <p>This was a recent attempt to achieve a "Pixel Perfect" web application. It's based on dribble artist <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/6798936-Food-fruits">Caroline's</a> design. It's not perfect obviously, especially without knowing exact measurements. It's mobile first, so desktop looks a little bit silly, but it's fully responsive. Pulled some slightly <a href="https://material.io/resources/icons/">Material Design icons</a> plus my own, and added some nifty animations for transitions. This is my first official use of SCSS, using just sublime build system rather then WebPack. Due to the small scope, housed the JS in the HTML file. </p>

                    <h2>Reserver</h2>
                    <p>This was another simple <abbr title="Progressive Web App">PWA</abbr> that evolved for work necessity. 12 members of our team were forced to use a single citrix portal in order to management client incidents. Anytime someone used it, if someone else was working with it already, they would get kicked out. We did our best to alert each other but sometimes we would miss messages. I created this app as a stopgap. It's a simple neomrophic button with gradient background opacity animations (since we still can't tween background gradients...) that sends a socket.io WebsScket message to the server reserving your status and alerting all connected clients of the state change. Non occupying clients can then "pend" the user sending them desktop notifications (if they opted in) and even posting in our discord chat via webhooks that they were waiting. Full <abbr title="Progressive Web App">PWA</abbr> manifest and desktop icons included for pinning to the taskbar!</p>

                    <h2>SVG Editor</h2>
                    <p>This was an earlier project to make my own online SVG editor. There's some decent ones out there but nothing quite met my requirements. Also wanted to take a stab at a decent touch screen ready editor, which there are even fewer out their in my experience. Highly experimental so a lot of the functionality needs reworked, such as my newer color wheel system also pictured. Also the point editor creates clickable DOM elements which is too much pollution for a larger shape for now. It does accommodate for alignment snapping vertically and horizontally, eventually right angles as well. Very happy with how the animations and effects came out so I will definitely be working on this again in the near future!</p>

                    <h2>Stompadon</h2>
                    <p>
                        Stompadon was my first ever web project over 10 years ago. I had made a number of flash games back in the day, but even then Flash was clearly dying. A friend wanted help supporting a kickstarter for a plush of a character she had designed. Since I knew flash was a no go, the next closest thing was HTML5, and the rest is history. The code is very rough, poorly defined variables and this was before I understood functions very well (pre-ECMA6 after all). Even still, it continues to run to this day and is still one of my favorites!

                    <p>
                        Get is a simple file server hosted on the same site. It supports clipboard pasting as well as click and drag file support. It sends the FormData to a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer">Multer</a> module that safely takes care of the file storage. It's not the cleanest system and it's certainly not available to public yet until I can properly secure everything.

                    <p>
                        This project was a bit sloppy, but it was a necessary step in order to organize my tech support job. There were some existing options out there but nothing quote met my needs, so I made it instead. It's effectively an advanced bookmark manager, with note taking, and ideally password management. What started as a joke became crucial for organizing my workflow, as we supported over 40 unique clients' stacks and a couple hundred sub clients. As I couldn't safely store passwords, this aspect got scraped as I was unable to meet the job's encryption requirements at the time. As all clients can be added in manually and stored as a JSON object through localstorage, it was infinitely customizable and exportable. It stored unique notes for each client as well, and even stored background color preferences. There was a break system being incorporated via socket.io but ultimately fell to the wayside as well. I hope to clean up this logic for some sort of organizational app someday.
